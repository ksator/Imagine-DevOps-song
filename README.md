Lyrics:    

```
Imagine no Developers   
It's easy if you try   
No Operations, no Change Management   
Cloud Servers virtualized   
 
Imagine all the people   
Deploying continuously   
   
Imagine no QA team  
It isn't hard to do   
NoSQL to be "Web Scale"   
Developers on-call too  

Imagine all Project Managers   
Using Agile methodology   

You may say I'm a dreamer   
But I'm not the only one   
I hope someday you'll join DevOps   
And our world will be as one   
  
Imagine no more Waterfall  
I wonder if you can   
No need for documentation  
A brotherhood of Kan... Ban   
  
Imagine former adversaries  
Sharing a git repository  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer   
But I'm not the only one   
I hope someday you'll join DevOps   
And our world will live as one   
```
